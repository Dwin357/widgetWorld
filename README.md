# Programmatic Landscape

## Germ of an Idea

On the one hand I think most coders would accept my describing code as "a 
structured collection of processes applied to some ends", but the first place I 
encountered something matching this description was in the institutional
practices of the military.  This resemblance always felt really significant, but
it was never obvious to me how I could dig deeper and explore the mystery.

The premise of this project is to first try and programmatically describe real 
world institutions as accurately as possible, and then explore what it would
mean to refactor these to follow design-patterns.

The conceit of this project is the speculation that this "structuring of 
processes towards an ends" can be made to be revealing of the observer, as well
as the observed.  Viewed from a certain angle we are each the structuring of 
some sensory processes towards an ends, so it makes fuzzy-logic sense that this
technique might leak into the observer's thought-patterns and  create a richer 
experience of the world.
